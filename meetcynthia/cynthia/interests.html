		<h2>Interests</h2>

		<h3>Web Design / Web Development</h3>
		I have been experimenting with web design for nine years now, 
		and I am still learning about all the cool things that can be 
		made with the simplest tools. I love taking the time to make 
		things visually appealing, as well as functional, and believe 
		that first impressions are the most important. If 
		your website or software application does not have am appealing 
		user-friendly interface, the users will not be inclined to give 
		the product a chance to demontrate its functionality and potential.
		<br /><br />
		I use CSS3 and HTML5 for my web work and I am mostly self-taught in 
		these languages.

		<h3>Graphic Design</h3>
		I enjoy creating and editing graphics in my free time. I mainly 
		use GIMP 2 to create my works. I do not have very much experience 
		with these tools and I am currently learning more through online 
		tutorials and self experimentation.
		<br /><br />
		A few simple examples of my work can be found on the 
		<a href="http://meetcynthia.com">homepage</a> of this website.

		<h3>Cognitive Science</h3>
		After taking a couple of Cognitive Science courses at UCSD, I have 
		developed a strong interest in the subject. Something that particularly 
		interests me is animal cognition and the current research that is being 
		done in that field.
		<br /><br />
		Information from my Animal Cognition class can be found 
		<a href="http://www.cogsci.ucsd.edu/~johnson/COGS143/">here</a>.
		<br />
		<a href="http://meetcynthia.com/cogs/poster.png">Here</a> 
		is a poster I created on the topic of tool use in corvids. Two videos of 
		the experiment can be found 
		<a href="http://www.cell.com/current-biology/supplemental/S0960-9822(07)01770-8">here</a>.
		<br />
		<a href="http://meetcynthia.com/cogs/paper.pdf">This</a> 
		is a paper I wrote on the topic of tool use in corvids.

		<h3>Arts</h3>
		I enjoy playing music in leisure and am an experienced pianist and percussionist. 
		I also enjoy playing the flute and have recently begun to teach myself to play 
		the violin. I enjoy playing pieces from the Classical era.
		<br /><br />
		I also enjoy photography and drawing, which I believe helps fuel my interest in 
		graphic design.
