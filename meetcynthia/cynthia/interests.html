			<h2>My Interests</h2>

			<h3>Web Design / Web Development</h3>
			I have been experimenting with web design for nine years now, 
			and I am still learning about all the cool things that can be 
			made with the simplest tools. I love taking the time to make 
			things visually appealing, as well as functional, and believe 
			that first impressions are the most important. If 
			your website or software application does not have am appealing 
			user-friendly interface, the users will not be inclined to give 
			the product a chance to demontrate its functionality and potential.
			<br /><br />
			I use CSS3 and HTML5 for my web work and I am mostly self-taught in 
			these languages.

			<h3>Graphic Design</h3>
			I enjoy creating and editing graphics in my free time. I mainly 
			use GIMP 2 to create my works. I do not have very much experience 
			with these tools and I am currently learning more through online 
			tutorials and self experimentation.

			<h3>Cognitive Science</h3>
			After taking a couple of Cognitive Science courses at UCSD, I have 
			developed a strong interest in the subject. Something that particularly 
			interests me is animal cognition and the current research that is being 
			done in that field.
			<br /><br />
			Information from my Animal Cognition class can be found 
			<a href="http://www.cogsci.ucsd.edu/~johnson/COGS143/">here</a>.
			<br />
			<a href="http://meetcynthia.com/cynthia/cogs/poster.png">Here</a> 
			is a poster I created on the topic of tool use in corvids. Two videos of 
			the experiment can be found 
			<a href="http://www.cell.com/current-biology/supplemental/S0960-9822(07)01770-8">here</a>.
			<br />
			<a href="http://meetcynthia.com/cynthia/cogs/paper.pdf">This</a> 
			is a paper I wrote on the topic of tool use in corvids.

			<h3>Arts</h3>
			I enjoy playing music in leisure and am an experienced pianist and percussionist. 
			I enjoy playing pieces from the Classical era.
			<br />
			I also enjoy photography, drawing, and watercolor painting, which I believe help 
			fuel my interest in graphic design.
