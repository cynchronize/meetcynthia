		<h2>Projects</h2>

		<h3>CrossTrack - A CrossFit Android Application</h3>
		<b>Project Vision</b>
		<br />
		We aim to produce a creative design with the 
		ease and fluidity of a seemingly simple application. With 
		simplicity comes usability.
		<br /><br />
		Our focus is on hardcore athletes who challenge their limits. 
		Many progressive athletes keep records of their accomplishments. 
		This application gives the athlete a way to view accomplishments while 
		he or she is still at the gym. An accomplishment could be a better time in 
		a 400 meter dash, or a personal best in the quantity of pull ups completed. 
		Whatever the case, this application provides the ability to track personal 
		bests and log them into your mobile device at the gym.
		<br /><br />
		<b>Technology Used</b>
		<br />
		This application was written mainly in Java using the Eclipse IDE.
		<br /><br />
		<b>Project Team</b>
		<br />
		CrossTrack was created by a team of 8 Computer Science students as 
		part of the CSE110 Software Engineering course.

		<h3>Muckraker News and Community Site</h3>
		I worked in a team of 4 students in the CSE135 Server-Side Web Applications course 
		to create a muckraker community website centered on the 2012 presidential election. 
		We learned about website security, server configuration, implementing a simple database, 
		and basic protection against malicious users.
		<br /><br />
		<b>Technology Used</b>
		<br />
		This website was created using HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, and MySQL.
		<br /><br />
		*This website is no longer live

		<h3>Good Morning Bakery Website [in progress]</h3>
		I am working together with a fellow Computer Science student to create a 
		website for a small family-owned bakery. The website will display products 
		sold at the bakery and include an order form page for online cake orders.
		<br /><br />
		<b>Technology Used</b>
		<br />
		This website is being developed using HTML, CSS, and PHP.

		<h3>MIPS Processor</h3>
		I worked together with a partner in the CSE141L Computer Architecture 
		course to implement a pipelined MIPS processor during the Spring 2013 
		academic quarter.
		<br /><br />
		<b>Technology Used</b>
		<br />
		This project was completed using Quartus II 12.0sp2, Altera ModelSim 10.0, 
		Verilog, and MIPS Assembly.
		<br /><br />
		<b>Documentation</b>
		Contact me for a copy of the datapath schematic. It is not posted because 
		the project requirements will likely be the same for future students.
