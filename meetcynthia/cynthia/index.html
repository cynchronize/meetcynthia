			My name is Cynthia. I am a software engineer, amateur cook, animal lover, and occasional artist.
			I completed my Computer Science education at UCSD and have been dabbling in web design on 
			my own since junior high. I am currently gaining experience and new technical 
			skills in the Computer Science industry. I enjoy being able to apply the concepts that I have 
			learned in school towards the projects that I am given, as well as having the 
			opportunity to utilize my creativity and problem solving skills.
			<br /><br />
			I hope to be able to take the skills and lessons that I have learned with me into 
			the future as I pursue a career in software development. My passion for 
			solving problems drives me to use my skills to create tools and applications for 
			people to use and enjoy.
